# User Interfaces (UI)

## (I)Python shell

Brightway can be used from the interactive Python shell.
[IPython](http://ipython.org/) is a nicer python shell that adds
shortcuts, shell commands, and a lot else.

## Jupyter Notebooks

[Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) are the probably the best way
to interact with Brightway2 (the
`Brightway2 examples <bw2-notebooks>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} are
all Jupyter notebooks). These lab notebooks open incredible
possibilities for interactive, reproducible, collaborative, and
understandable science. Read more about the [praise IPython has been
getting](http://ipython.org/#announcements), and see [some awesome
demos](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks).
A collection of interactive training notebooks is provided at
training.brightway.dev

## Activity Browser

The [Activity
Browser](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser)\` is a
native user interface for Brightway. It is a separate open-source
software project, currently in development.
