User Interfaces (UI)
===============

(I)Python shell
---------------

Brightway can be used from the interactive Python shell. `IPython <http://ipython.org/>`_ is a nicer python shell that adds shortcuts, shell commands, and a lot else.

Jupyter Notebooks
-----------------

`Jupyter notebooks <https://jupyter.org/>`_ are the probably the best way to interact with Brightway2 (the :ref:`Brightway2 examples <bw2-notebooks>` are all Jupyter notebooks). These lab notebooks open incredible possibilities for interactive, reproducible, collaborative, and understandable science. Read more about the `praise IPython has been getting <http://ipython.org/#announcements>`_, and see `some awesome demos <https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks>`_.
A collection of interactive training notebooks is provided at training.brightway.dev

Activity Browser
----------------

The `Activity Browser <https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser>`_` is a native user interface for Brightway. It is a separate open-source software project, currently in development.
