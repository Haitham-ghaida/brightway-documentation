# Ecoinvent

## Import

### Which `Ecoinvent` file should I download?

Ecoinvent makes several versions of each system model available. For instance:

```
ecoinvent 3.3_xxx_ecoSpold02.7z
ecoinvent 3.3_xxx_lci_ecoSpold02.7z
ecoinvent 3.3_xxx_lcia_ecoSpold02.7z
ecoinvent 3.3_xxx_lcia-cumulated-matrices_xls.7z
ecoinvent 3.3_xxx_lci-cumulated-matrices_xls.7z
```

You want to download and import `ecoinvent 3.3_xxx_ecoSpold02.7z`. If your import process is taking a long time or a lot of memory, double check to make sure you have the right version.
