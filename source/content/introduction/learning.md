## Introduction

-   [New Brightway2
    tutorial](https://github.com/maxkoslowski/Brightway2_Intro/blob/master/BW2_tutorial.ipynb)
    by Maximilian Koslowski.
-   [Getting Started with
    Brightway2](https://github.com/brightway-lca/brightway2/blob/master/notebooks/Getting%20Started%20with%20Brightway2.ipynb).

This notebook provides a basic introduction to Brightway2 functionality,
including importing and using the FORWAST database. After you go through
the introduction notebook, you are ready to start exploring, and the
manual will try to help you when you get lost.

## Brightway2 seminar

A Brightway2 seminar was held in ZÃ¼rich in 2017, and the [teaching
material is
available](https://github.com/PoutineAndRosti/Brightway-Seminar-2017).

## Example notebooks

In general, this manual tells you *what* to do; the notebooks tell you
*how* to do it. Here are some example notebooks showing various themes:

-   [Activities and
    Exchanges](https://github.com/brightway-lca/brightway2/blob/master/notebooks/Activities%20and%20exchanges.ipynb)

different software implementations. Here are some notebooks that show
the steps needed to import various databases.
