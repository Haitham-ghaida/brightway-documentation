# User Interfaces (UI)

```{warning}
This version of the documentation is for older releases of Brightway (`legacy` or `brightway2`). It includes only those pages which are relevant to the legacy releases. To access the complete documentation, please switch the the [latest version](https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest/). The legacy releases [supports the popular Activity Browser user interface](../setup/ui.md), but do not have the latest features of Brightway. You can learn more about [the different versions of Brightway here](../faq/brightway.md).
```

## (i)Python Shell

Brightway can be used from the interactive [iPython shell](http://ipython.org/).

## Jupyter Notebooks

Brightway is intended to be used primarily with [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). These interactive Python-enabled lab notebooks open incredible possibilities for interactive, reproducible, collaborative, and understandable science.
## Graphical User Interface (Activity Browser)

Brightway is a command-line tool intended primarily for use with [Jupyter Notebooks and the iPython shell](https://jupyter.org/). It does not provide a native graphical user interface. However, this functionality is provided by the Activity Browser project. To set up Activity Browser for use with Brightway, follow the [official installation instructions](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser#installation).
